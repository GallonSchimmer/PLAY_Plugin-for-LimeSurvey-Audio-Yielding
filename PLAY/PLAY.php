/**
 * The PLAY class extends the LimeSurvey PluginBase to provide audio functionalities within LimeSurvey. 
 * It enables embedding of audio files in survey questions and handles events triggered throughout 
 * the survey lifecycle, such as before rendering questions and completing the survey. This class 
 * subscribes to several events to inject audio handling logic where necessary, ensuring audio files 
 * are appropriately managed and played as per survey configurations.
 *
 * The class initializes with database connections to manage audio files associated with surveys and 
 * logs important information for debugging purposes. It ensures audio files are unique to each session 
 * and handles the complexity of audio file selection based on predefined codes associated with survey questions.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - The class should be instantiated by the LimeSurvey plugin manager.
 * - It automatically hooks into the LimeSurvey event system.
 *
 * Example:
 * Assuming PLAY is correctly installed and activated as a LimeSurvey plugin, it works automatically 
 * based on its subscription to LimeSurvey's internal events.

 * Initializes the PLAY plugin by subscribing to various LimeSurvey events necessary for audio handling.
 * It sets up the plugin to interact with different stages of the survey lifecycle, such as rendering questions,

 * 
 * This method also establishes a connection to the database, which is used to manage the audio files associated
 * with the surveys. It logs the status of the database connection to help with troubleshooting and ensure the
 * plugin is ready to handle audio functionalities correctly.
 * 
 * Events Subscribed:
 * - 'beforeQuestionRender': To handle audio embedding before a question is rendered.
 * - 'newSurveySettings': To manage plugin settings within the survey's administrative interface.
 * - 'beforeSurveyPage': To execute logic before a survey page is loaded, ensuring audio files are ready.
 * - 'afterSurveyComplete': To handle any cleanup or data processing needed after the survey is completed.
 *
 * The database connection uses PDO and catches any exceptions thrown during the connection attempt, logging
 * the outcome accordingly.
 *
 * @throws PDOException If the connection to the database fails, an exception is logged and handled within the method.

    /**
 * Handles operations before a survey question is rendered by embedding audio content, validating codes, and managing session data.
 * This method is triggered for each question rendering event in a survey where the PLAY plugin is active.
 * It performs several checks and operations to ensure the appropriate audio content is embedded based on the question's requirements and session data.
 *
 * The method first checks for the existence of the event object and retrieves the necessary data like question ID and survey ID.
 * It then verifies if the question type is allowed to have embedded audio based on predefined allowed types. If a question meets the criteria,
 * the method proceeds to check and validate a code associated with the question, which helps in selecting the appropriate audio file.
 * If the code is valid and an audio file URL is set in the session or newly obtained, it embeds an audio player into the question content.
 *
 * Finally, the method also handles the registration of client-side JavaScript necessary for audio playback and interaction within the survey.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This method is automatically invoked by LimeSurvey during the question rendering phase if the PLAY plugin is active and configured.
 *
 * @param none Direct parameters are not used, but the method operates using the global event context provided by LimeSurvey.
 * @return void The method does not return a value but directly modifies the survey's question rendering behavior by embedding audio and scripts.
 * @throws none No exceptions are thrown directly from this method, but it logs various levels of information and warnings based on execution conditions.

 * The method uses regular expressions to validate the code format and extract the necessary components. If the

    /**
 * Handles operations that need to be executed before a survey page is displayed to the participant.
 * This method is triggered by LimeSurvey's 'beforeSurveyPage' event and is responsible for setting up
 * session-specific data and including necessary scripts that monitor or manipulate audio files for the survey.
 *
 * The method retrieves the survey and session identifiers, logs relevant information for debugging, and
 * ensures that the necessary session variables are initialized and set. It also includes the 'audioFileMonitor.php'
 * script, which handles the dynamic management of audio files based on session activities.
 *
 * Furthermore, it checks if the current user has the necessary permissions to update survey content,
 * ensuring that only authorized modifications are made to the survey's structure or content.
 *
 * If any issues are encountered, such as missing survey permissions or inability to find the survey model,
 * the method logs the appropriate errors and terminates execution to prevent improper page rendering or data handling.
 *
 * Example:
 * This method is part of the event-driven architecture of LimeSurvey plugins and is not directly called but
 * executed in response to the survey's lifecycle events.
 *
 * @param none This method does not take parameters directly but operates on the event context provided by LimeSurvey.
 * @return void This method does not return a value but directly affects the survey session and logs operations.
 * @throws none Direct exceptions are not thrown by this method, but it logs errors related to permissions and data retrieval.

	/**
 * Retrieves the current session ID for a given survey from the LimeSurvey session context. This method is
 * essential for associating survey-specific data with a unique session, ensuring that any modifications
 * or data logging performed by the plugin are accurately attributed to the active survey session.
 *
 * The session ID is used primarily to manage and track interactions within a specific instance of a survey,
 * particularly for functions that depend on the session's uniqueness such as audio file handling and user
 * interactions tracking.
 *
 * If no session ID is found in the current context (i.e., the survey session is not yet initialized), a
 * default value of 'default' is returned. This behavior ensures that the function gracefully handles cases
 * where the session data might not yet be set.
 *
 * Example:
 * This method can be called whenever a session-specific operation needs to be performed, such as logging
 * session-specific events or handling audio files that are tied to a particular session of the survey.
 *
 * @param int $surveyId The identifier for the survey whose session ID is being retrieved. This is necessary
 *                      to locate the correct session information within a potentially complex session structure.
 * @return string Returns the session ID associated with the survey, or 'default' if no session is currently active.
 * @throws None This method does not throw exceptions but will return a default value in absence of specific session data.

 * 'afterSurveyComplete' LimeSurvey event. It primarily focuses on logging important session data and updating

 *
 * The method retrieves the survey ID from the event, logs it, and checks for its existence. If the survey ID
 * is not found, the method logs an error and exits to prevent further processing errors.
 *
 * It includes external PHP files that handle subfolder counting logic (`counterFolder.php`), retrieves the
 * current session ID, and updates a session variable specifically used for tracking audio-related activities.
 *
 * Finally, it calls the `updateSubfolderCounter` function to increment the count of subfolders used for the
 * survey, ensuring that audio file usage is balanced and tracked accurately across multiple survey instances.
 *
 * Example:
 * The method is not directly called but is executed as part of the LimeSurvey plugin event system upon the
 * completion of a survey.
 *
 * @throws Exception If the survey ID is not retrieved, an exception is logged and the method exits.
 * @note This method assumes that session management and the counter updating functions are properly implemented
