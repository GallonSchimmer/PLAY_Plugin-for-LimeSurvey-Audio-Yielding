# Configuration of the Paths for the Plugin

Hereâ€™s how you can configure the PLAY plugin's paths and settings for your LimeSurvey installation. This setup will ensure the plugin operates smoothly with your existing LimeSurvey system and adheres to best practices for security and performance.

## Database Connection and Paths
- **Database Connection:** Configure the PHP Data Objects (PDO) to connect to your MySQL database. Set attributes to handle exceptions for robust error management.
  ```php
  $pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=[DB_HOST];dbname=[DB_NAME]", "[DB_USER]", "[DB_PASSWORD]");
  $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
  ```

- **JavaScript File Path:** Define a web-accessible path for the JavaScript file that handles audio playback functionality.
  ```php
  $jsFilePath = '/[path_to_limesurvey]/upload/plugins/PLAY/audioPlayer.js';
  ```

- **Database Credentials:**
  - `DB_HOST` - Typically 'localhost' or your specific database host.
  - `DB_NAME` - The name of your database.
  - `DB_USER` - Your database username.
  - `DB_PASSWORD` - Your database password.

- **Base Directory for Audio Files:** Set the base directory where the audio files are stored, ensuring it is accessible via the web server.
  ```php
  $baseDir = "/[path_to_web_directory]/audioSurvey/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/";
  ```









# Configuration in `config.php` for Logging and Debugging

- **Yii Logging:** Configure logging to capture essential information and errors. This is useful for debugging and maintaining the application.
  ```php
  'components' => [
      'log' => [
          'class' => 'CLogRouter',
          'routes' => [
              [
                  'class' => 'CFileLogRoute',
                  'levels' => 'error, warning, info',
                  'logFile' => 'application.log', //the file will be located under [path_to_limesurvey]/ 
              ],
              // Additional log routes can be added here
          ],
      ],
  ],
  ```

- **Debug Mode Setting:** Enable strict PHP error reporting to help in identifying potential issues during the development or deployment phase.
  ```php
  'debug' => 2,  // Strictest level for development. Use '0' for production environments.
  ```

## Additional Tips
- **Security:** Always ensure that database credentials and paths are secured and not exposed in your code repositories or to unauthorized users.
- **Path Configuration:** Adjust the paths according to your actual server directory structure. Ensure that the paths in `$baseDir` and `$jsFilePath` accurately reflect your deployment environment.



To accurately configure the `$baseDir` in your PLAY plugin for LimeSurvey, it's crucial to know the absolute paths on your server. This ensures that all file paths are correctly set up, enabling smooth operation and file access within the plugin. You can determine the necessary paths using a simple PHP script called `info.php`. Here's how you can utilize this script to find out the essential paths:










# Using `info.php` to Determine Paths

1. **Create the `info.php` File:**
   - Open a text editor.
   - Create a new file named `info.php`.
   - Insert the following PHP code into the file:
     ```php
     <?php
     echo '<h3>Server Paths</h3>';
     echo '<p><strong>Document Root:</strong> ' . $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '</p>';
     echo '<p><strong>Script Filename:</strong> ' . $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] . '</p>';
     ?>
     ```
   - Save the file.

2. **Upload `info.php` to Your Web Server:**
   - Using your preferred FTP client or through your hosting control panel, upload the `info.php` file to the root directory of your LimeSurvey installation.

3. **Access `info.php` via a Web Browser:**
   - Open a web browser.
   - Navigate to the URL where you uploaded `info.php`. For example:
     ```
     http://yourdomain.com/info.php
     ```
   - This page will display the paths of your server:
     - **Document Root:** Shows the root directory of your web server.
     - **Script Filename:** Displays the absolute path of the `info.php` file.

4. **Determine `$baseDir`:**
   - From the output, you can determine the necessary path to configure your `$baseDir`. Use the "Document Root" for relative web paths and "Script Filename" for understanding directory structure.
   - Update the `$baseDir` in your PLAY plugin configuration to reflect the correct path based on your server's architecture.

5. **Secure or Remove `info.php`:**
   - After obtaining the required information, it's a good security practice to either delete the `info.php` file from your server or restrict access to it, as it can reveal sensitive information about your server's file system.

Using `info.php` allows you to quickly and accurately configure server paths for your PLAY plugin in LimeSurvey, ensuring that all file interactions are correctly handled. This method is especially useful for custom server environments or when transitioning between different hosting setups.















# SQL Commands to Create Required Tables

To extend the LimeSurvey database for use with the PLAY plugin, you need to create additional tables to manage audio uploads and track their usage within surveys. Below are the SQL commands to create these tables, which are essential for the plugin to operate effectively. These tables store information about audio files and their usage, and are accessible via prepared SQL statements in the plugin's PHP code.

1. **Table for Audio Uploads:**
   This table stores the URLs of audio files that have been uploaded in the Resources of the Survey. Each entry includes an automatically incrementing ID and the URL of the audio file.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE audio_uploads (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       audio_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Table for Tracking Used Audio Files:**
   This table logs each instance an audio file is used within a survey session. It includes an ID, the session (or ResponseID) identifier, the audio URL, and a timestamp for when the audio was used. The timestamp defaults to the current time at insertion.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE used_audio_files (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       session_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       audio_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       used_datetime DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```








# JSON information upload in Survey Response

To effectively store and utilize JSON data generated by the PLAY plugin within LimeSurvey, it's essential to integrate this data into the survey response in the final question. This can be accomplished by embedding a specific JavaScript code within the HTML editor of the last survey question. Here are the detailed steps and the code necessary to implement this integration:

### Key Steps to Integrate JSON Data into LimeSurvey Responses:

1. **Access the Question Editor:**
   - Navigate to the LimeSurvey question where you want to include the JavaScript. This should be the last question in your survey.

2. **Open the Source Editor:**
   - In the question editor toolbar, click on the "Source" button to switch to the HTML source editor. This allows you to enter HTML and JavaScript directly.

3. **Embed JavaScript Code:**
   - Paste the JavaScript code provided below into the source editor. This script will fetch and display the JSON data automatically generated by the plugin, and store it in the response of the last question.



In the PLAY plugin for LimeSurvey, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) plays a crucial role in managing the audio file infrastructure. It is utilized to store critical data regarding the indexing of subfolders, the quantity of these subfolders, and an array that tracks the usage frequency of each subfolder. This structure is essential for ensuring that the audio files are used efficiently and systematically throughout the survey lifecycle.

#### Usage of JSON for Subfolder Management:

- **File Creation:** A JSON file named `counterSubfolderSession.json` is automatically created and stored under `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/`. This file contains data related to subfolder usage, helping to manage the load and distribution of audio files effectively.
  
- **Data Structure:** The JSON structure includes:
  - `SubfolderTimesUsed`: An array that increments each time a subfolder is accessed, ensuring each audio file's equitable use.
  - `index` and `quantity`: These values store the current subfolder index and the total number of subfolders, respectively.






# Understanding Placeholders in the Last Question Script

When configuring and setting up the PLAY plugin or similar tools within LimeSurvey, certain paths and identifiers need to be adjusted according to your specific LimeSurvey installation and survey structure. Hereâ€™s how to adapt placeholders and use real identifiers from your LimeSurvey installation:


#### 1. **LimeSurvey Installation Directory:**
   The `/limesurvey5` in the path is a placeholder for the directory where LimeSurvey is installed on your server. During installation, LimeSurvey allows you to choose a directory name that suits your organizational needs. This name could vary (e.g., `/limesurvey`, `/survey`, etc.), so replace `/limesurvey5` with the actual directory name used during your LimeSurvey setup:
   ```plaintext
   /[your_limesurvey_directory]/upload/surveys/783317/files/counterSubfolderSession.json
   ```

#### 2. **Survey, Group, and Question IDs:**
   The numeric codes, such as `783317X61X664`, represent specific identifiers within LimeSurvey:
   - `783317` is the Survey ID.
   - `61` is the Group ID within the survey.
   - `664` is the Question ID within that group.

   These identifiers are automatically assigned by LimeSurvey when a new survey, group, or question is created. You must replace these placeholders with the actual IDs from your specific survey:
   ```plaintext
   /upload/surveys/[SurveyID]/files/counterSubfolderSession.json
   ```

   And in HTML or JavaScript, you might reference an element like:
   ```html
   <div id="ls-question-text-[SurveyID]X[GroupID]X[QuestionID]">...</div>
   ```

#### 3. **Input Field ID in HTML:**
   `answer783317X61X664SQ001` is an example of an HTML element ID used in LimeSurvey to target an answer input field for a specific question:
   - `SQ001` typically refers to a specific subquestion or item part of the main question.

   This needs to be adapted based on your actual survey's structure:
   ```html
   <input type="text" id="answer[SurveyID]X[GroupID]X[QuestionID]SQ001" ... />
   ```

### Example of Applying Real Identifiers

Assuming your LimeSurvey installation directory is `/surveys`, your Survey ID is `100001`, your Group ID is `10`, and your Question ID is `100`, hereâ€™s how you would adjust the paths and identifiers:
- **JSON Path for Audio File Counter:**
  ```plaintext
  /surveys/upload/surveys/100001/files/counterSubfolderSession.json
  ```

- **HTML Element for Survey Question:**
  ```html
  <div id="ls-question-text-100001X10X100">...</div>
  ```

- **HTML Element for Answer Input:**
  ```html
  <input type="text" id="answer100001X10X100SQ001" ... />
  ```

Whenever you configure paths and identifiers in LimeSurvey, itâ€™s critical to use the actual values that correspond to your specific installation and survey setup. This ensures that scripts, plugins, and HTML elements function correctly and interact as expected within the LimeSurvey environment. Always check your LimeSurvey administration panel or directly within the database to obtain accurate identifiers for surveys, groups, and questions.









# Script for the last Question in Survey

To integrate the JSON data into LimeSurvey, you can utilize a Multiple Short Text question type at the end of the survey. This question will not only display the usage data but also act as a mechanism for updating the subfolder usage upon survey completion.

```html
<div class="question-text">
  <div class="ls-label-question" id="ls-question-text-783317X61X664">
    In the answer of this question is the counter saved:
    <div id="counterInfo">Loading counter information...</div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        function fetchData() {
          var url = '/limesurvey5/upload/surveys/783317/files/counterSubfolderSession.json';
          url += '?v=' + new Date().getTime(); // Append current time to avoid cache issues
          fetch(url)
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(displayData)
            .catch(handleError);
        }

        function displayData(data) {
          var allCounters = '';
          if (data.SubfolderTimesUsed && Array.isArray(data.SubfolderTimesUsed)) {
            data.SubfolderTimesUsed.forEach(function(counterValue, index) {
              allCounters += 'Counter for Subfolder ' + (index + 1) + ': ' + counterValue + '; ';
            });
          }

          for (var key in data) {
            if (key !== 'SubfolderTimesUsed') {
              var value = data[key];
              if (!isNaN(value)) {
                allCounters += 'Counter for ' + key + ': ' + value + '; ';
              } else {
                allCounters += 'Invalid counter value for ' + key + '; ';
              }
            }
          }
          document.getElementById('counterInfo').innerHTML = allCounters;
          var inputField = document.getElementById('answer783317X61X664SQ001');
          if (inputField) {
            inputField.value = allCounters;
          }
        }

        function handleError(error) {
          console.error('Error fetching counter data:', error);
          document.getElementById('counterInfo').innerHTML = 'Failed to load counter information';
        }

        fetchData();
      });
    </script>
  </div>
</div>
```







# Round Robin Management:

The PLAY plugin uses a Round Robin approach to cycle through audio file subfolders. This method ensures that every subfolder is used evenly across survey iterations. As the survey reaches its completion (`afterSurveyComplete()` event), the plugin updates the index for the next subfolder to be used in subsequent survey sessions.

#### Application in Surveys:

Imagine a survey with 7 questions where each requires an audio player. You should organize subfolders named `00`, `01`, `02`, etc., with audio files named sequentially (e.g., `00.mp3`, `01.mp3`, up to `07.mp3`). Each audio file should correspond to a question, facilitated by the specific code system which will be detailed in the sections discussing validation and error handling. 

This setup ensures that every survey session can pull audio files from a systematically managed queue within LimeSurvey.


**Audio Uploads Table Integration with PLAY Plugin:**

When the PLAY plugin is installed through the LimeSurvey Plugin Manager, it automatically begins monitoring and recording the URLs of all audio files located in the `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/[Subfolders]/` directory once a survey starts. It is crucial for the subfolders within the `/files` directory to be named sequentially as `00`, `01`, `02`, `03`, `04`, etc., to ensure the plugin can properly recognize and interact with them.

Additionally, the audio files within each subfolder should also be named in a consecutive order such as `00.mp3`, `01.mp3`, `02.mp3`, `03.mp3`, `04.mp3`, etc. This systematic naming convention allows the plugin to automatically organize and manage the audio files effectively.

This organization of audio files and subfolders is critical for the plugin's functionality, allowing it to seamlessly integrate audio into survey questions. A detailed explanation of how this organization aids the automatic processing and embedding of audio within LimeSurvey will be provided further in the documentation.








# Audio File Organization for PLAY Plugin

To effectively organize audio files for use with the PLAY plugin in LimeSurvey, following a structured approach to the storage and naming of audio files is essential. This organization facilitates the pluginâ€™s Round Robin system for managing audio playback throughout the survey. Here's a detailed explanation of how to set up your audio files and directories:

1. **Top-Level Audio Storage:**
   - Store all audio files not intended for plugin use under the `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/` directory of your LimeSurvey installation.

2. **Sample Audios:**
   - Place any sample audios, which are not to be handled by the plugin, directly under the `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/` directory.
   - Example path for a sample audio: `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/SampleAudio.mp3`.
   - These sample audios can be used for introductory questions or instructions and will not be monitored or managed by the PLAY plugin.
   - Sample audios are not included in the database tables designed for tracking audio usage by the plugin.

3. **Organizing Audios for Plugin Use:**
   - Create subfolders within the `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/` directory, named sequentially as `00`, `01`, `02`, etc.
   - These subfolders will store the audio files that are to be managed by the plugin.

4. **Naming Audio Files:**
   - Within each subfolder, name your audio files sequentially starting from `00.mp3`, `01.mp3`, `02.mp3`, etc.
   - This naming convention is crucial for the pluginâ€™s Round Robin mechanism, ensuring each audio file is uniquely identified and systematically utilized.

5. **Setup Example for a Survey:**
   - Suppose you have a survey with several questions where each requires an audio prompt. Hereâ€™s how you might set it up:
     - For introductory remarks or sample questions, use audios placed directly under `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/` like `SampleAudio.mp3`.
     - For the main survey questions, organize audios within subfolders named `00`, `01`, `02`, etc., at `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/00/00.mp3`, `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/01/01.mp3`, and so on.

 This setup is critical for maintaining the integrity and consistency of the audio elements within your surveys.

# Structuring Your Survey

To ensure that the PLAY plugin operates effectively within LimeSurvey, it is essential to follow a structured approach both in terms of survey design and in the implementation of the plugin. Hereâ€™s how to set up your survey and configure questions to integrate with the PLAY plugin effectively:

- **Introductory Group of Questions:**
  - Use the first group of questions in your survey for introductory purposes, such as welcome messages or sample audio that does not require plugin interaction.
  - These introductory elements should not be associated with the specific naming conventions required for plugin management since they do not interact with the PLAY plugin functionalities.

- **Subsequent Question Groups:**
  - Create subsequent groups for questions that will utilize the plugin.
  - Ensure that these groups are distinctly separate from the introductory group to avoid confusion and to streamline the management of audio files.

### Question Naming and Validation

- **Coding System for Questions:**
  - To integrate a question with the PLAY plugin, name the question using a specific code structure: `audQ + [AudioNumber] + [QuestionType]`.
  - **Example:** `audQ00k`
    - `audQ` is a constant prefix used to denote that the question will interact with the PLAY plugin.
    - `00` corresponds to the audio file name (`00.mp3`) stored in the designated subfolder.
    - `k` indicates the question type. Only specific question types are compatible with the PLAY plugin. It only accepts lower case. 

- **Compatible Question Types:**
  - The PLAY plugin is designed to work with the following LimeSurvey question types:
    - `k` (Multiple Numerical Input)
    - `x` (Text Display)
    - `f` (Array)
    - `s` (Short Free Text)
    - `m` (Multiple Choice)
    - `l` (List (Radio))
  - Questions that do not fall under these types will not interact with the PLAY plugin. They can be used for other purposes within the same survey.

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Audio File Organization:**
  - Correspond the audio file naming (`00.mp3`, `01.mp3`, etc.) directly with the part of the question code (`00`, `01`, etc.).
  - Store audio files within subfolders (`00/`, `01/`, etc.) under the `/upload/surveys/{$surveyId}/files/` directory to maintain order and facilitate the plugin's audio management.

- **Survey Configuration:**
  - Ensure each audio-equipped question is set up correctly with the `audQ` prefix and proper audio file identifiers to ensure the plugin can recognize and handle these elements appropriately.
  - Regularly update and maintain the naming conventions and storage paths to reflect any changes in survey structure or audio file organization.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will ensure that your LimeSurvey setup is optimized for using the PLAY plugin, enhancing the functionality of your surveys with robust audio handling capabilities. This structured approach helps maintain clarity and functionality across diverse survey components, leveraging audio effectively to enhance respondent engagement and data integrity.

# Error Handling Using the Help Attribute

The PLAY plugin for LimeSurvey incorporates a robust error handling system that utilizes the 'Help' attribute of questions to provide real-time feedback on potential setup errors. This functionality is crucial for administrators to identify and resolve issues before officially launching surveys. Hereâ€™s how the plugin uses the 'Help' attribute for error handling:

#### Invalid Code Format:
- **Error Message:**
  ```plaintext
  "Invalid code format: {$code}. Unable to extract AudioNumberValue and QuestionType."
  ```
- **Trigger Condition:** This error appears if the question name does not adhere to the required naming convention (`audQ[AudioNumber][QuestionType]`), indicating a failure to parse essential components like AudioNumberValue and QuestionType.
- **Resolution:** Administrators should revise the question code to match the expected format, ensuring that each component (prefix, audio number, and question type) is correctly specified.

#### Unrecognized Subfolder Name:
- **Error Message:**
  ```plaintext
  "No audio files found in subfolder: {$currentSubfolder} for session ID {$sessionId}. Please check the subfolder name and audio filenames."
  ```
- **Trigger Condition:** This message is displayed when the system does not find any audio files in the expected subfolder, possibly due to an incorrect subfolder name or an empty subfolder.
- **Resolution:** Verify that the subfolder exists, is correctly named (typically two digits like `00`, `01`, etc.), and contains the properly named audio files (`00.mp3`, `01.mp3`, etc.).

#### Unrecognized Question Type:
- **Error Message:**
  ```plaintext
  "Invalid code format: {$code}. Unable to extract AudioNumberValue and QuestionType."
  ```
- **Trigger Condition:** Similar to the invalid code format, this error can also indicate that the question type specified in the code is not supported by the plugin.
- **Resolution:** Ensure that the question type is one of the recognized types (`K`, `X`, `F`, `S`, `M`, `L`) that the plugin can handle. Adjust the question code accordingly.

#### Incorrectly Named Audio File:
- **Error Message:**
  ```plaintext
  "No audio file matching AudioNumberValue: {$audioNumberValue} found. Check the subfolder and filenames."
  ```
- **Trigger Condition:** This error occurs when no audio file in the subfolder matches the AudioNumberValue specified in the question code.
- **Resolution:** Check that audio files within the subfolder are named following the sequence outlined in the question code. Correct any discrepancies between the audio file names and the AudioNumberValue.
